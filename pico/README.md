# Pico

![Pico](docs/pico.png)

Pico is an open-source zero-knowledge virtual machine (zkVM) that transforms how developers build secure, scalable, and high-performance decentralized applications. Drawing on the innovative [Glue-and-Coprocessor](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/09/02/gluecp.html) architecture, Pico fuses the efficiency of specialized circuits with the adaptability of a general-purpose zkVM. This unique design empowers you to craft tailored proof systems that meet the diverse needs of your applications.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, please ensure that you have installed all the [requirements](./docs/requirements.md). For installation and setup instructions, refer to the [Installation Guide](https://pico-docs.brevis.network/getting-started/installation) and follow the steps outlined in [Quick Start](https://pico-docs.brevis.network/getting-started/quick-start) section in [Pico Docs](https://pico-docs.brevis.network/).

## Key Features
Pico's design is rooted in the need for adaptable, high-performance ZK systems that can keep up with the rapidly evolving cryptography research. Rather than relying on a "one size fits all" solution, Pico's modular architecture lets you:

- **Leverage Interchangeable Proving Backends**: Select from multiple proving backends to achieve the best performance and efficiency.
- **Integrate App-Specific Circuits**: Seamlessly incorporate specialized circuits/coprocessors to accelerate domain-specific computations.
- **Customize Proving Workflows**: Assemble and fine-tune proof generation pipelines tailored to your application's specific requirements.

## Supported Proving Backends
One of Pico's most innovative features is its ability to seamlessly switch between multiple proving backends.
Currently, Pico supports generating proofs in [all phases](https://pico-docs.brevis.network/writing-apps/advanced/proverchain) — RISCV, CONVERT (RECURSION), COMBINE (RECURSION), COMPRESS (RECURSION) 
and ONCHAIN (for EVM) — with both STARK on KoalaBear and STARK on BabyBear.
For CircleSTARK on Mersenne31, Pico currently supports the RISCV-Phase, with RECURSION and EVM phases coming soon.

- STARK on KoalaBear (prime field $p = 2^{31} - 2^{24} + 1$): Supports generating proofs for
  - [x] RISCV-Phase
  - [x] RECURSION-Phase
  - [x] EVM-Phase
- STARK on BabyBear (prime field $p = 2^{31} - 2^{27} + 1$): Supports generating proofs for
  - [x] RISCV-Phase
  - [x] RECURSION-Phase
  - [x] EVM-Phase
- CircleSTARK on Mersenne31 where $p = 2^{31} - 1$). Supports generating proofs for
  - [x] RISCV-Phase
  - [ ] RECURSION-Phase
  - [ ] EVM-Phase

## Security
As of February 2025, Pico has not been audited and is not recommended for production use.

## Acknowledgements

Pico draws inspiration from the following projects, each representing cutting-edge advancements in zero-knowledge proof systems. 
- [Plonky3](https://github.com/Plonky3/Plonky3): Pico's proving backend is based on Plonky3, extending its modularity to the zkVM layer to enable the flexible selection of proving fields and systems that best fit each use case.
- [SP1](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1): Pico derives significant inspiration from SP1's chip design and their constraints. Its recursion compiler and precompiles originate from SP1.
- [Valida](https://github.com/valida-xyz/valida): Pico's implementation of cross-table lookups is inspired by Valida's pioneering work in this area.
- [RISC0](https://github.com/risc0/risc0): Pico's Rust toolchain is based on the one originally developed by RISC0.
